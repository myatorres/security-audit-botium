# Control Categories and Types
*This was provided to me as a doc in the activity, asked me to review it and keep this in mind when doing the activity. I summarized the doc in my own words.*

Cybersecurity controls are grouped into three primary categories:

## 1. Administrative / Managerial Controls
These focus on policies, procedures, and human-related factors. They help define responsibilities, regulate access, and manage security practices. Examples include password policies, access control policies, and disaster recovery planning.

## 2. Technical Controls
These involve digital tools and technologies like firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and intrusion detection/prevention systems. Theyâ€™re essential for detecting, preventing, or mitigating technical threats.

## 3. Physical / Operational Controls
These protect physical infrastructure. Examples include locks, CCTV, badge readers, and fire suppression systems. These controls help prevent unauthorized access and physical damage.

## Control Types

Controls can serve different purposes:

- **Preventative:** Stop incidents from occurring (e.g., password policies, firewalls)
- **Detective:** Identify incidents as they occur (e.g., CCTV, IDS)
- **Corrective:** Restore systems after an incident (e.g., backups, disaster recovery)
- **Deterrent:** Discourage malicious activity (e.g., warning signs, locked cabinets)

These layers work together to provide **defense in depth**, ensuring comprehensive risk mitigation across administrative, technical, and physical domains.
